# AlgoHIIT
## Aims of this study are:

To make you an overall BPM view of your HIIT protocol.
This algorithm is made for a Polar H10 and make a mean about different measures such as : 
* The entire condition
* During each intervall
* During effort time
* During post effort time
* A graphic representation of your effort and post effort

These data tells you more about your vascular stress, an overall cinetic of your recuperation and if you are reach -or not- your goal in BPM terms.
	
	HIIT_analysis file grouping : 
	
	* `DAT` : data extracted from PolarH10 adn convert into .csv
	* `PRG` : Main script and function include in the script 
	* `RES` : Graphic and results report.
	      
	      
## Usage

* Clone or download the repository
* On your computer, open `main.sce` then run the script with F5 or click the button with grey triangle
	  
## Notes 
	  
* Install [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org) scilab on your computer, For mac Users: click [here](https://www.utc.fr/~mottelet/scilab_for_macOS.html)

* Please, convert your .xls or .xlsx data from Polar H10 in .csv and drag it in `DAT`

* Do not modify the names and organisation of the directories.
  The `DAT`+`PRG`+`RES` structure is expected when initialising in `InitTRT.sce`


Don't hesitate to tell me if you have any issues with the algorithm or if you want help with to make it better 

Enjoy :)
